Here is the list of basic shortcodes.

**COVID-19 Global Stats Card**
[covid-widget type="global-card"]

**COVID-19 Global Stats Wide (full width)**
[covid-widget type="global-wide" bgcolor="#043785" textcolor="#ffffff"]

**COVID-19 Affected Countries Data Table**
[covid-widget type="table"]

**Note**: You must have to use country name as defined in data source. Please check country name list on [https://covid19-wp.netlify.app/](https://covid19-wp.netlify.app/). e.g: "United States" will not work but "US" or "USA" will work. Similarly "South Korea" won't work. This is because the data source listed country names like` that. You have to use [shortcode generator](https://covid19-wp.netlify.app/), select country from drop-down and then copy full shortcode or copy defined country name inside your shortcode.
